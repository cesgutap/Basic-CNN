# Tin Can Detection and Classification Documentation

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that can accurately detect and classify different types of tin cans based on input images. The project utilizes popular libraries such PyTorch for image processing and deep learning tasks. The development environment used is Google Colab, which provides a convenient platform for running the code and leveraging its resources.

The key objectives of the project are as follows:
- Implement a CNN architecture for tin can detection and classification.
- Train the model using a labeled dataset of tin can images.
- Evaluate the model's performance on a separate test set.
- Provide an application interface to load and predict labels for new images.

Throughout this documentation, we will provide detailed information about the project, including the data preparation, model architecture, training process, evaluation metrics, and usage guide.

## Installation Guide

To run this project, follow the steps below:

1. Ensure that you have a Google account.
2. Go to Google Colab at https://colab.research.google.com/.
3. Click on "File" in the Colab menu, then select "New Notebook".
4. In the new notebook, click on "Runtime" in the Colab menu, then select "Change runtime type".
5. Choose "Python 3" as the runtime type and select "GPU" as the hardware accelerator (if available) for faster training.
6. Upload the project files to your Google Drive, including the dataset, notebook file, and any other required resources.
7. Open the notebook file in Colab.
8. Make sure the notebook has access to the required libraries by installing them, if necessary. For example:
    ```python
    !pip install opencv-python
    !pip install torch torchvision
    ```
10. Follow the instructions provided in the notebook to execute the code cells and run the project.

Note: Make sure to update the file paths in the code if you place the dataset or any other resources in a different location in your Google Drive or you might have some problems creating the datasets.

## Data Preparation

To train and evaluate the tin can detection and classification model, a labeled dataset of tin can images is required. Follow the steps below to prepare the dataset:

The dataset must be separate into different folders for each class. The recommended directory structure is as follows:

    ```
    dataset/
    ├── Class_1/
    │   ├── img_1_1/
    │   ├── img_1_2/
    │   └── ...
    ├── Class_2/
    │   ├── img_2_1/
    │   ├── img_2_1/
    │   └── ...
    └── Class_3/
        ├── img_3_1/
        ├── img_3_1/
        └── ...
    ```

Each class should have its own folder, and the images belonging to each class should be placed in the respective class folder.

## Model Architecture

The tin can detection and classification model is built using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture. CNNs are well-suited for image classification tasks due to their ability to learn spatial hierarchies and extract relevant features from images.

The model architecture consists of the following layers:

1. Input layer: This layer receives the input image data and preserves its spatial dimensions.

2. Convolutional layers: These layers perform convolutions on the input image, applying learnable filters to extract important features.

3. Activation layers: ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) activation functions are applied to introduce non-linearity into the model.

4. Pooling layers: MaxPooling is used to reduce the spatial dimensions of the feature maps, aiding in translation invariance and dimensionality reduction.

5. Fully connected layers: These layers process the high-level features extracted by the convolutional layers and make predictions based on them.

6. Output layer: This layer produces the final class probabilities for tin can classification.

The specific architecture details, including the number of layers, filter sizes, and activation functions, can be found in the source code.

The model architecture is implemented using the PyTorch library.

## Model Deployment

Deploying the tin can detection and classification model allows it to be used in real-world scenarios for identifying and classifying tin cans. These are some of the steps you could follow to deploy the model:

1. Save the trained model's weights and architecture to disk, using a format that can be easily loaded by inference code, such as a saved model file or serialized format.

2. Set up the runtime environment for deploying the model. This may involve installing the necessary dependencies, libraries, and frameworks required to run the inference code.

3. Write inference code that loads the saved model, processes input images, and performs predictions using the deployed model.

4. Integrate the inference code into your application or system. This may involve connecting the code to a user interface, an API, or any other input/output mechanism.

5. Test the deployed model thoroughly to ensure its correctness and reliability. Use sample images or real-world data to verify that the model produces accurate predictions.

6. Monitor the deployed model's performance and make necessary updates or improvements as new data becomes available or as the model's requirements change.

7. Consider implementing additional features, such as logging, error handling, or performance optimization, to enhance the deployment of the model.

These steps are just some general guidelines. Please, adpat them to your own application before deploying the model.
